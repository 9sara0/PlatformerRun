## Possible solutions
  * ReactJS Android with Ruby on Rails backend
    - Pros: Familiar JS syntax, can develop for either iOS or Android, Rails quick to get started
    - Cons: We don't know how to make this an app and not a webpage. not found many detailed tutorials
  * Java Android app
    - Pros: mature language, been around a long time, lots resources on making mobile apps
    - Cons: Unfamiliar language, compiled language (new to us).
  * Swift iOS app
    - Pros: initial research looks easier to learn, built for iOS, know another cohort has made a swift app
    - Cons: Unfamiliar language
  * Using an existing running app, use API to connect website
    - Pros: using most technologies that we know, can add lots in a short time
    - Cons: doesn't really feel like a game
